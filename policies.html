<p><h2>A Note about the philosophy of this course: </h2></p><br>
Printmaking classes in particular can tend to focus on the basic technical skills (since there are so many!) and fail to encourage students to develop their own unique interests. To study printmaking should not be about completing assignments and learning correct technique but to make artwork utilizing the tools at hand. While there are skill-based aspects of the course that are important, the rules of printmaking are not meant to hinder creativity. So in that spirit, we will work together in a way that allows you to consider the possibilities of your own interests and how those relate to printmaking. 


<br>
<br>
<p>
<h1>This is very important: </h1>Do not miss demo days! It is unlikely that the demo will be repeated for your benefit. If you have a valid reason please speak to the instructor before hand and maybe we can work something out. There are so many demos in the semester and a lot of work to be completed during class time that you should carefully consider the ramifications of missing a class.

			<br><br>

			<p>Absences + Deadlines</p>
			Projects are expected to be completed on the due date. You should be prepared to present your work to the class and participate in the critique. No excuses. Assignments turned in late will drop half letter for each day it is late. 
			More than three unexcused absences will result in a full grade drop. Being late to class three times unexcused is considered an absence. A doctor's, deans note must accompany excused absences. It is your responsibility to find out what you missed for assignments if you are not present in class. Use your time wisely.


<p>Terms for Grading</p>

<ul>
	<li>Has the student employed the criteria and techniques set forth in the assignment?</li> 
		<li>Was the artwork produced for the assignment created deliberately and thoughtfully?</li> 
			<li>Has the student visually interpreted an idea relating to their interests or the theme of the assignment?</li> 
				<li>Has the student demonstrated an understanding of the basic elements and principles of art? </li> 
ie. line, shape, color, value, form, texture, space, balance, contrast, emphasis, movement, pattern, rhythm, and variety</li> 
<li>Has the student produced a consistent print edition where appropriate for the assignment?</li> 
	<li>Were the safety procedures and safe handling of tools and chemicals in the print shop followed correctly by the student?</li> 
		<li>When appropriate has the student participated both in discussions and during class work time on their assignments? Did the student complete the assignment on time and in full?</li> 
</ul><br><br>


<p>Sketchbook</p>
Your Sketchbook is a tool for research and personal investigation from your life or imagination. This is one of the most important aspects of this class. Carry your sketchbook constantly! You are establishing the modalities of how you will work as an artist within it. We will look at your sketchbook progress during the semester.

<ul>
	<li>Here are some notes on the Sketchbook:</li> 
		<li>It should be large enough to contain your ideas but not so large that it is a hindrance to take with you</li> 
			<li>It will be idea driven, organized and make sense when you go back to review your notes</li> 
				<li>It will contain clear notes on processes introduced in the class, readings, slide lectures, and critiques</li> 
					<li>Keep everything, no tearing out pages or throwing ideas away — they could be useful later</li> 
						<li>Reflect your thinking on assignments, steps, sketches and development of your imagery </li> 
							<li>Show your progress on working within themes and / or your own artistic interests</li> 
								<li>It is not just a scrapbook</li> 

</ul>

<br>

<p>Artist’s Statement</p>
As part of this course you will be developing an artist statement in conjunction to your work. At the very minimum it should be one half typed page or equivalent to 250 words. It is not a biography or a CV, it is an opportunity for the artist to establish the context within which the work may be understood. 

<ul>
	<li>Here are the steps in drafting that statement, and these will be due at various points in the semester.

		<li>Start by reading the provided text by Nyland Blake’s on artist’s statements</li> 
			<li>Next work on list making, create lists of your interests, answer the questions what? and why?</li> 
				<li>First Draft, will draw from your lists and expand and improve your context</li> 
					<li>Second Draft, will revise the first draft and will have recommendations as well as questions to consider from the instructor</li> 
						<li>Final Draft, will be a succinct statement, this should expand to a full page and be a completely fleshed out statement about your work, taking into consideration what you learned in your critiques</li> 

</ul>
<br>

			<p>Absences + Deadlines</p>
			Projects are expected to be completed on the due date. You should be prepared to present your work to the class and participate in the critique. No excuses. Assignments turned in late will drop half letter for each day it is late. 
			More than three unexcused absences will result in a full grade drop. Being late to class three times unexcused is considered an absence. A doctor’s, deans note must accompany excused absences. It is your responsibility to find out what you missed for assignments if you are not present in class. Use your time wisely.
<br><br>

			<p>Studio Etiquette & Work time</p>
			The assigned projects will require at least 5 to 10 hours and any additional hours of outside class time per week. Printmaking during class time will be limited since there will be so many people working in the shop. Manage your time wisely. You must be present for a demo to gain access to the studios. There will be particular hours that the studio will be available to you after class and on the weekends, with the AT and printshop monitors and you should be proactive with managing your time. 

			There will be no shop time during the semester breaks. You should plan your time accordingly to allow for enough time in the print shop to order materials and complete your projects. Read the syllabus and know what’s happening, come to class prepared to take notes, print your work and participate. If you are not sure about something—please ask!  There will be monitors and the AT around to guide you safely and you should <h1>never be printing alone in the studios!</h1> <br>Be aware of deadlines and be ready for critique days. Exhibit a good work ethic, be inquisitive and consistent in your efforts. Clean up as you go since the monitors, AT or instructor are not there to clean up after you and please be thrifty with materials so that there is enough materials for everyone. If you destroy or damage equipment you will be responsible for the monetary value to replace that equipment. Treat the space with the upmost respect.

		<h1>University Statements</h1><br>
		
		<p>Academic Integrity </p>
		<br>
We, the Lehigh University Student Senate, as the standing representative body of all undergraduates, reaffirm the duty and obligation of students to meet and uphold the highest principles and values of personal, moral and ethical conduct. As partners in our educational community, both students and faculty share the responsibility for promoting and helping to ensure an environment of academic integrity. As such, each student is expected to complete all academic course work in accordance to the standards set forth by the faculty and in compliance with the University’s Code of Conduct.
<br>
<br><p>Course Statement on Academic Integrity</p>
The work you do in this course must be your own. This means that you must be aware when you are building on someone else’s ideas—including  the ideas of your classmates, your professor, and the authors you read—and explicitly acknowledge that you are do so. If you ever have questions about drawing the line between others’ work and your own, ask me and I will give you clear guidance or you may visit Lehigh Library’s ‘Proper Use of Information’ page <a href="http://libraryguides.lehigh.edu/plagiarism">here </a> 
<br>
<br>
<br><p>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities </p>
If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting accommodations, please contact both your instructor and the Office of Academic Support Services, Williams Hall, Suite 301 (610-758-4152) as early as possible in the semester.  You must have documentation from the Academic Support Services office before accommodations can be granted.
<br>
<br><p>The Principles of Our Equitable Community </p>

<br><p>Lehigh University endorses </p>
<a href=http://www.lehigh.edu/~inprv/initiatives/PrinciplesEquity_Sheet_v2_032212.pdf>The Principles of Our Equitable Community.</a> We expect each member of this class to acknowledge and practice these Principles. Respect for each other and for differing viewpoints is a vital component of the learning environment inside and outside the classroom.
<br>
<br><p>Lehigh University Policy on Harassment and Non-Discrimination</p>
Lehigh University upholds The Principles of Our Equitable Community and is committed to providing an educational, working, co-curricular, social, and living environment for all students, staff, faculty, trustees, contract workers, and visitors that is free from harassment and discrimination on the basis of age, color, disability, gender identity or expression, genetic information, marital or familial status, national or ethnic origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.  Such harassment or discrimination is unacceptable behavior and will not be tolerated. The University strongly encourages (and, depending upon the circumstances, may require) students, faculty, staff or visitors who experience or witness harassment or discrimination, or have information about harassment or discrimination in University programs or activities, to immediately report such conduct. 
<br>
<br><p>Statement on Lab Fees</p>
Lab fees for this and other designated courses in the Department of Art, Architecture and Design are set at $100 per student. They provide funding for many of the consumable materials, supplies, and services provided for your use in the course. Most of these are purchased on your behalf at quantity discounts that would be unavailable if purchasing the materials individually. Depending on the class, lab fees may also provide for specialized design software accessible to you in the department’s PC and Mac labs, and through remote use in the virtualization of those computer terminals. Those classes that utilize the university’s Design Labs will have a portion of their fee directed to cover materials and other shop consumables such as blades, abrasives and adhesives. In courses that include site visits to off-campus locations, lab fees may also cover some or all the cost of group travel and transportation. 
In this course, the majority of the lab fee is budgeted for: materials and supplies including paper, adhesives; tools including rulers, blades, brushes, and applicators
The lab fee will provide the minimum required for the successful completion of the course. However, throughout the semester, you may also need to purchase additional materials and supplies on your own.  What you decide to purchase and how much you spend will vary depending on the design choices you make. Spending more money may not make for a better project, although sometimes a good idea requires an investment to see it through. More likely, it will require time and effort rather than money.  It is recommended that total additional out of pocket expenses for this course be kept between $50 and $75. 

<br>
<br><p>End-of-Semester Cleanup</p>
Friday Dec 2nd Mandatory Clean up of studio 10am — 3pm <br>
If you skip out on this cleanup day you will drop one letter grade!  Do not miss!<br>
When classes are over for the semester, before you depart campus and before the end of examination period, you are individually responsible for cleaning out the desk or work area that was assigned to you, and any projects, materials, or waste that remain there.  This means completely clearing off your desk surface; cleaning out any drawers or storage that were assigned to you; disposing of waste in or around your desk; and taking home or disposing of all projects that you produced for the course.  Your work area should be completely empty and clean, the way that it looked on day one of the semester.  Your instructor will review your work area at the end of the semester to ensure you have completed doing this.
